Question 1: Command used was “mkdir Assignment1” to make the directory, then I used “cat >> Assignment1.txt” to make the txt file that contains the commands I used.

Question 2: I used “echo $SHELL” using the global variable to echo my current Shell, then I used “echo $HOME” to echo my home directory path
	echo $SHELL output: “/bin/bash”
	echo $HOME output: “/mnt/scratch/SP24_CS131_Jyotika/ronsp24”

Question 3: I used “id -u” to check what my UID is and I used “groups” to check what group I belong to. 
	id -u output: 1222
	groups output: ronsp24 S78

Question 4: I am allowed to “cd” “ls” and “ls -l” in the temp directory, however I can’t creat files under it due to removing my “write” permission from myself
